Learn more about the APIs defined in the library by reading our
[technical documentation](https://jitpack.io/com/github/material-motion/catalog-android/1.0.0/javadoc/) and our
[Starmap](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/).

## Installation

### Installation with Jitpack

Add the Jitpack repository to your project's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Depend on the [latest version](https://github.com/material-motion/catalog-android/releases) of the library.
Take care to occasionally [check for updates](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin).

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.material-motion:catalog-android:1.0.0'
}
```

### Using the files from a folder local to the machine

You can have a copy of this library with local changes and test it in tandem
with its client project. To add a local dependency on this library, add this
library's identifier to your project's `local.dependencies`:

```
com.github.material-motion:catalog-android
```

> Because `local.dependencies` is never to be checked into Version Control
Systems, you must also ensure that any local dependencies are also defined in
`build.gradle` as explained in the previous section.

**Important**

For each local dependency listed, you *must* run `gradle install` from its
project root every time you make a change to it. That command will publish your
latest changes to the local maven repository. If your local dependencies have
local dependencies of their own, you must `gradle install` them as well.

You must `gradle clean` your project every time you add or remove a local
dependency.

### Usage

How to use the library in your project.

#### Editing the library in Android Studio

Open Android Studio,
choose `File > New > Import`,
choose the root `build.gradle` file.

    git clone https://github.com/material-motion/catalog-android.git
